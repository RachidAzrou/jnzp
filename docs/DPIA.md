## 8. International Data Transfers

**Status**: NO international data transfers outside the EU/EEA.

**Hosting**: All data is stored in Supabase EU region (Frankfurt, Germany).

**Third-party processors**: All processors are EU-based or have adequacy decisions:
- Lovable Cloud / Supabase: EU-based (Frankfurt)
- WhatsApp Business API: Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) in place

**Future transfers**: If international transfers become necessary, we will implement:
- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
- Adequacy decision reliance (where applicable)
- Supplementary measures (encryption, data minimization)

---

## 9. Children's Data

**Status**: JanazApp does NOT intentionally process data of children under 16 years old.

**Policy**: Users must be 18+ to create an account. If a child is the deceased individual, their data is processed with explicit consent from the parent/guardian (family member who creates the dossier).

---

## 10. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling

**Status**: NO automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant effects (GDPR Art. 22).

**Processing activities**:
